/* 
ENUMS
Enums are looks almost like an array but they are very restricitve choice and only from that choice you can use certain things.
Example Usecase:
âœˆðŸ›«ðŸ›¬
    Lets say you are travelling in an aeroplane and in the airplace always you asked about 3 kinds of seats Window, middle or aisle seat. Now imagine if a user who
is alloting you a seat just mentioned as corner seat instead of aisle seat. this strange thing which is a small choas in the naming convenstion can 
create a nightmare for the staff inside the plane to show that seat to user.
    So as a programmer you need to restrict the usecase of what word user is using while doing booking or recieving an order in such places we use ENUMS
    Incase of aeroplane there is just window, corner, or aisle seat and there is no such term called corner seat.

ðŸ¥°ðŸŽˆðŸ˜˜
    Similar to that when we are processing the order of the user we want to restrict the order phase that the order is in a given moment. like whether the order is in
recieved state?
ordering state?
processing state?
delevered state? or 
cancelled state?
and these states we need to retrict using ENUMS
    So for this we need to update our order schema.
